Simple ruby script that attempts to create a haiku/palindrome poem.
Still needs many improvements and does not follow the 5-7-5 haiku rules all the time.  

Test it yourself

git clone https://github.com/khamoud/haikupal.git

cd haikupal

ruby pal.rb

Keep running the script until you get something you like. There is a large number of palindromes in the arrays that you can do anything with if you adjust the scripts correctly. 

Examples:
Do offer ref food.
Trays simple help, missy art!
Im a tune nut, am I?

God saw I was dog.
Mr. Owl ate my metal worm.
So many dynamos!

Nate bit a tibetan.
Stressed was I ere I saw desserts.
Never odd or even.

Sex-aware era waxes.
Let Omro open one poor motel.
Tino dump mud on it.

As I said it is not perfect but it is a work in progress.
