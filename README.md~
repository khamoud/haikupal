Simple ruby script that attempts to create a haiku/palindrome poem.
Still needs many improvements and does not follow the 5-7-5 haiku rules all the time.  

test it yourself

git clone https://github.com/khamoud/haikupal.git

cd haikupal

ruby pal.rb

keep running the script until you get something you like. There is a large number of palindromes in the arrays that you can do anything with if you adjust the scripts correctly.
